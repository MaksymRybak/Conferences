Programming language Python.
We've seen next libraries in use:
- Pandas library to analyze the data
- Sklearn library for machine learning in python

Before the selection of algorythm to use we have to analyze the data that we have. To understand better the data. 
To be able interpret correctly the result.
To understand better the data we can plot it and build some graphics. Based on relations inside the data store.

When we have choosen an algorithm to use, first, we have to provide the training data set. In this way we teach the algorithm.
To test the result, we have to provide another data set that contains the data of which we want to retrieve some usefull 
information.
Very important is to have reasonable data.
