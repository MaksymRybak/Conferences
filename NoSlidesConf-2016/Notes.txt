Trivago talk by @pistenprinz:

Trivago is PHP based web platform.
The talk was about Trivago's workflow regarding development of a new feature.
Everything starts with the creation of a new task on ticket management platform (eg: Jira, YouTrack).
The developer creates new branch where he/she will push new changes.
For every feature they have a dedicated folder.
In features.xml they manage on/off settings of every feature, and other config params.
They use template framework to develop FE. Everythins starts from the base template. 
They have automated tests for FE, every web part is under some tests, depends on the part.
They are using https://symfony.com/ as web framework.
They also have some development opened to the public on github https://github.com/trivago.
When the code on the feature branch is ready to be merged to the master, 
they create pull request and other persons (NOT the feature developer!) of the team have to review the code and merge it to the master.

PS: 
IDE seen during the presentation was WebStorm.
BitBucket for GIT.
Jenkins for CI and CD.
