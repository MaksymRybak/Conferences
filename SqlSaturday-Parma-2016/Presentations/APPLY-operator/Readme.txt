APPLY operator in action
Speaker(s):  Andrea Martorana Tusa 
APPLY operator is a T-SQL table operator that allows to boost query perfomance and to solve complex calculation problems in an very 
efficient way. 
But it isn't easy to understandt how does it work and how it can be applied to our queries. 
In this session, we will examine the various types of APPLY operator (CROSS APPLY, OUTER APPLY) to understand it's behaviour and 
the power it holds.
We will go through many real world cases to show how we can use the APPLY operator when writing queries instead of JOINs 
and we will show how performances can be improved by using this operator the right way.
