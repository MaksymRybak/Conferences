SQL Server Infernals: Worst Practices in Action
Speaker(s):  Gianluca Sartori 
Let’s face it: Best Practices are too many to really know them all and choose which ones should be applied first. 
Does your telephone ring all the time? Do your users ask for that “quick report” that instead takes ages and keeps 
changing every time you think it’s done? 

Have you ever thought that in dire times avoiding Worst Practices could be a good starting point and you can leave 
fine tuning for a better future? If the answer is “yes”, then this session is for you: we will discover together how 
not to torture a SQL Server instance and we will see how to avoid making choices that in the long run could turn out 
to be not as smart as they looked initially.
